# Binary-Search-Tree-Personal-Project

Project Details: This project is a personal project of mine where I have implemented the Binary Search Tree. It contains the common operations performed by a Binary Search Tree which are insert, remove, search, getHeight, and print. Each file contains an operation that is explained through the comments.

Memory: All the nodes are dynamically allocated. I have also made sure to keep a track of all the nodes I remove from the list and free them properly. To confirm this I have used Valgrind to make sure there are no memory leaks and initialization errors.

Compilation: Use the make command to compile the program through the makefile. then use the executable named BST (./BST) to execute the program.
